# Typescript full stack monorepo starting point

 This is a starting point for al my full stack project using:
* Yarn
* Typescript
* NodeJS
* React
* eslint (with google style)
* Babel for the backend
* Husky for pre-commits
* Jest for tests

Feel free to download an archive and use as a starting point.

Before anything run `yarn upgrade` to make sure everything is on the latest version
